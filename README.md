# Echo_Ease


Certainly! Hereâ€™s a paragraph you could use in your GitHub repository for EchoEase:

EchoEase is a machine learning project aimed at detecting respiratory ailments like asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) through cough sounds. This project leverages an ensemble model built with features extracted from diverse datasets collected from global clinics and researchers. EchoEase achieved an impressive 92% detection accuracy, providing a robust tool for respiratory health monitoring. The app is developed in React Native and Python, integrating various machine learning models to optimize performance and accuracy.

Note: At the time of this project, I was relatively new to Git and version control practices. Consequently, the repository might lack optimal structure and documentation standards. I appreciate your understanding and hope you find the work insightful despite these early-stage learning curves.
